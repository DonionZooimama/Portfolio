Design

~Like system
Use a timer and time how long till the next like. From the target audience find their recent photo and like it. First check if the picture has been liked and then proceed.
When getting a likers list also like that picture.

~Comment system
Use a timer to check if you can comment on a users picture. From the target list find and comment using a fixed list of comments.

~Combo of both
When a timer is complete like and comment on the picture.
The problem with this is i don't know if i should be commenting and liking on profiles who are smaller or on bigger targeted accounts. Liking users with small followings will make them feel important and commenting on bigger accounts will bring people in.
People who tag others are probably very interested in the content so by following those people might have a high conversion rate.
